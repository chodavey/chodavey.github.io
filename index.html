                    Uni fell gracefully (or perhaps not so gracefully) into into my hands on the fateful day of November
                    5th, 2022.
                    At the time Uni was already 2 months and 13 days (74 days) old. His birthday is on August 23rd,
                    2022, and as I write on about
                    him in his very first issue, I realized he's well on his way to becoming 4 in 6 more months. Time
                    flies like crazy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The way I got Uni is a bit unique. I got him through a friend of a friend who already had an older
                    cat,
                    but that older cat wasn't getting along with Uni - so much so that it had come to the point in which
                    he was
                    asking around to see if anyone wanted to adopt from him. I recall getting a message from my friend
                    about him in the afternoon.
                    I was stopped at a traffic light with no intention of getting a pet at the time, but when I read her
                    message, I
                    don't really know what went through my mind. I think I was at a turning point in my life. I just
                    decided to bite the bullet and try something
                    I've never done before. I accepted
                    to adopt Uni; I didn't really even question it. The act was a bit unspeakable, just because I've
                    never really made such a significant decision so quickly. I didn't know if I was even allergic to
                    cats. Just an hour or two after the message, Uni was in my hands. Everyone who knew me was taken by
                    surprise when they heard the news. One day I suddenly became a cat owner.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now it just feels like Uni was always meant to be a part of my family. Every morning, he will wake
                    me up for food. There have been days when if it wasn't for him, I would've been late for work
                    because I would've
                    stayed asleep. In that sense, one could say we need each other. I would like to write more about
                    him, but I think I'll need to stop here in the interest of time.
